# DateUtility 
CSC470 Software Engineering // Java Dates Class and Intro to JUnit Testing.  Links to Classes where code was written for assignment are listed below.

### Assignment 1: Java Dates
Create a Java project called DateUtility and an org.usd.csci.util package.  Create a Java class called DateUtility.java.  
This class will have a main() method.  You will also create an Exception class, InvalidDateException.java, within the 
org.usd.csci.util package. InvalidDateException will extend Exception, have a default constructor, and have an additional 
constructor that takes a String parameter representing a message, and calls the base constructor

### Assignment 2: JUnit Test for DatUtility.java
The objective of this assignment is to introduce you to JUnit testing for Java code. You will create a a JUnit test class 
DateUtilityTest for your DateUtility class.  You are to create a test method ( @test ) for each method in your DateUtility class.
